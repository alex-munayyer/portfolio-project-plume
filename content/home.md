sectionOneDescription: Most companies failed to recognize that a device is only as intelligent as the network it’s connected to. ISPs were blind to performance inside the home and relied on expensive, time consuming truck rolls to investigate concerns. As a result, customers are stuck with generic WiFi, unsafe networks, and a gaping hole where awesome experiences could be. We set to work, designing a new way forward from scratch.
