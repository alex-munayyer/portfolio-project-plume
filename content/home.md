sectionOneDescription: Most companies failed to recognize that a device is only as intelligent as the network itâ€™s connected to.
              ISPs were blind to performance inside the home and relied on expensive, time consuming
              truck rolls to investigate concerns.
              As a result, customers are stuck with generic WiFi, unsafe networks, and a gaping
              hole where awesome experiences could be. We set to work, designing a new way forward from scratch.
